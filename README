MapLight - A Ruby wrapper to the MapLight web service api.

Pre-requisites

*MapLight api key

Apply for a MapLight api key at http://maplight.org


*Gem dependencies

  $ [sudo] gem install json restclient [micronaut mocha cucumber]

*Note* 'micronaut', 'mocha' and 'cucumber' are needed if you plan on running the examples:

  $ rake examples 

or the features

  $ cucumber features

and if I were you then I would! ;)

These will show the state of play ... 


Getting started.

Look at any of the features files. These should provide an idea of usage.
